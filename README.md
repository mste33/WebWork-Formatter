## WebWork-Formatter
#Online tool to covert standard complex equations into a format which webwork accepts.

WeBWorK is an online homework delivery system primarily used for mathematics and science. It allows students to complete their homework over the web, and receive instantaneous feedback as to the correctness of their responses. 

Inputting an equation as an answer to a question is not simple, especially if the equation is long and complex. 

# eg.

Equation that needs to be inputed: $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$

Acceptable WebWork version of the equation: sqrt(3x-1)+((1+x)**2)

# A more complex eg. 

Equation that needs to be inputed: $42x((3x^2+7)^6)((-7x^2+4)^{10}) - 140x((-7x^2+4)^9)(3x^2+7)^7$

Acceptable WebWork version of the equation: (42x(((((3x^2)+7)^6))))((-7(x^2)+4)^10)-140x((-7(x^2)+4)^9)((3(x^2)+7)^7)
